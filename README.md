# Clustering of cells in brain tissue

Code for performing clustering analysis of cells in tissue. Used in the paper [Differential Expression and Cell-Type Specificity of Perineuronal Nets in Hippocampus, Medial Entorhinal Cortex, and Visual Cortex Examined in the Rat and Mouse](http://www.eneuro.org/content/4/3/ENEURO.0379-16.2017). Implements a friends-of-friends clustering algorithm.
